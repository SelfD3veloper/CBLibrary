# CBLibrary

This library provides a defined Architecture to work with objects, clases, services, views and artifacts based on my experience developing Android projects :)

  - Avoid writing code from 0
  - I'm a developer so I know that sometimes its boring to have to create your Classes again
  - It's so easy to integrate
  - A library from MÃ©xico 

### Version
1.0

### Files

The packages are:
* [Artifacts] - There are some implementations of Adapters for ListView and ViewPager, you only need to extend this class and create the view.
* [Business] - Provides behavior as a business model of the system that includes a memento handler to maintain the states of information and representation handler according to present messages required
* [Dialogs] - My custom implementation to present custom dialogs, there are support for blur render script over the back view
* [Interfaces] - Some interfaces to decouple code.
* [Services] - Some classes and object to validate information, create images, create blurred images and a lot of objects
* [Utils] - Some utils lol, for date, files, load images, etc
* [ViewController] - Custom implementation to manage multiples views with only one Activity, It's similar to the view controller from iOS
* [Widgets] - Custom views :D

### TODOs

 - Fragments support
 - Clear code
 - Support level 23
 - Integration with kootlin
